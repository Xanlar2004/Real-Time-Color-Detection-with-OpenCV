  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This project demonstrates real-time color detection using Python and OpenCV. The program isolates and tracks specific colors in a video feed by converting RGB to HSV color space, allowing precise color detection based on hue, saturation, and value. Applications include object tracking, augmented reality, and robotics. Here are the features:<br>
     1. Real-Time Color Detection: Tracks colors in live video feeds.<br>
     2. HSV Tuning: Adjustable HSV sliders to isolate colors dynamically.<br>
     3. Applications: Supports robotics, AR, and automated color-based tracking.<br></p>
  
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>Python Libraries:<br>
     Numpy: For numerical computations.
     cv2 (OpenCV): For image processing and computer vision.<br></p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>Set Up Python Environment: Install Python if not already..<br>
     Install Required Packages: pip install numpy opencv-python<br>
     Run the Code: Open color-detection.py in VS Code. Execute the code to start detecting colors in real-time.<br></p>
